# Scraping-SunglassHut-from-API

#  Through an API (Application Programming Interface), one can gain access to the data of an application or operating system. 
Therefore, APIs depend on the owner of the said dataset. The data can be either offered for free or be available at a cost. 
The owner can also limit the number of requests that a single user can make or the amount of data they can access.
While web scraping gives you the option to extract data from any website through web scraping tools, 
APIs provide direct access to the type of data you would want.

In web scraping, the user can access the data till it is available on a website. 
However, access to the data might be either too limited or expensive when it comes to API.

With API, data extraction is usually from only one website (unless it is some aggregator), 
and through web scraping, data is accessible from multiple websites. 
Further, API lets you obtain only a specific set of data.

When it comes to web scraping, there is reliance on proxy servers which is not the case with API. 
The web scraping tool conveniently organizes the extracted data into a structured format. 
But, on the other hand, a developer will have to organize the data obtained with the help of API programmatically.

The automatic storing of data through the web scraping technique enables the user to download the same later. 
This function is not possible in an API. 
Plus, as compared to API, web scraping is much more customizable, complex, and has a set of rules.

This project is all about Scraping a website, which I could have render it's Javascript website with Selenim-Helium to extract the data from API.
